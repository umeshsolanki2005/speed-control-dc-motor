# speed-control-dc-motor
I used the basic electrical circuit for controlling DC motors, and understood the control DC motors using the L298N motor driver and the Arduino board.Learnt about the different components used and their functions/applications. Made the connections as shown and uploaded the code into the arduino(micro controller) using arduino compiler Got incomplete output repeatedly due to insufficient voltage in the battery, this problem was solved by using a dc voltage converter with 12v output
the push button reverses the direction of rotation when pressed while the potentiometer controls the speed of the dc motor.
